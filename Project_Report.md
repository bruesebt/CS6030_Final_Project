# Problem 
The overarching goal of SURF was to save software developers time and effort when extracting data from user feedback, specifically in app store reviews. Reviews contain vital information, and most developers are not going to spend time sifting through user reviews to obtain information pertaining to their mobile app. There may be a team responsible for interacting with these reviews, but will likely not extract very much useful information from said reviews.
