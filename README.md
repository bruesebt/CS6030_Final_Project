# CS6030_Final_Project
Repo for Brad Bruesewitz's CS6030 Final Project.

In this project, I explored the research paper "What would users change about my app? Summarizing app reviews for recommending software changes". I downloaded their replication package, which I have uploaded to this repo. I ran their SURF tool over the XML input files they provided and collected the results.
